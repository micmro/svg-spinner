Themeable, cachable SVG loading spinner
=======================================


SVG loading spinner using CSS animation (and JS animation as fallback).

Takes the fill colour as parameter in the hash of the URL - so it is still only downloading and caching one version when using different colours.


Changing the colour
-------------------
Change the `#color=%23f00` (red = `f00`) part of the url to pass in different colours by hex (3 or 6) or name.
